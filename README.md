# Tic-Tac-Toe
I MADE A THING,

I made this on Codecademy, I still need to learn how to compile on VSCode or just get a standalone compiler. Until then here's this part of the code.
There's some kinks to be worked out, and I still need to get the functions working without error, I'll get around to it. Have fun!

Edit: I was looking at my files on my PC and realized I never posted the fixed version of Tic Tac Toe on here. It's very basic and had a lot of issue
while making it, but after testing it should work without fail now. Hope it works for you!
